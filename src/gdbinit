# When (not if) pretty printing fails you and causes GDB to time out, you may
#  need to uncomment this line to aid corrective action troubleshooting.
#  Troubleshooting steps could include:
#  * Disable pretty printing here
#  * Break the debugger at the same point you were timing out before
#  * Manually enable pretty printer within the Momentix "Debugger Console"
#    with "enable pretty-printer"
#  * Perform "info locals" within the Momentix "Debugger Console" and observe
#    timeout before offending local variable
#  * Use "print /r <variable>" and compare to python printer to figure out how
#    to resolve the issue
#disable pretty-printer
